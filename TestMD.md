```
CodeDeploy can deploy application content that runs on a server and is stored in Amazon S3 buckets,
GitHub repositories, or Bitbucket repositories. CodeDeploy can also deploy a serverless Lambda function.
 You do not need to make changes to your existing code before you can use CodeDeploy.
```

## Why is it an important need?:
```
CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to:
- Rapidly release new features.
- Update AWS Lambda function versions.
- Avoid downtime during application deployment.
- Handle the complexity of updating your applications, without many of the risks associated with
error-prone manual deployments.
```

## Use cases
```
- Automate deployments to remove manual operations. Repeat an application deployment across
  different groups or instances using a file and command-based install model.
- Deploy to many hosts. 
- Use advanced deployment techniques.
- Monitor health and rollback.
```
